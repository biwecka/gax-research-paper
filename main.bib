   abstract = {The construction of timetables is a problem that is relevant for many applications, most notably for educational institutions. While the timetable of schools reflects how most of the day and the week is going to unfold in terms of which courses take place when, where and by whom, spontaneous and unforeseeable absences are common, disturbing the schedule defined by the timetable. For that reason, at schools and other institutions that cannot or do not want to simply drop the affected lessons on the cost of the students, substitution plans are supposed to regulate these occurrences. However, if a timetable can be well designed in general, but when it comes to substitution plans, which actually reflect how the day is going to unfold, these might be suboptimal with respect to how good the quality of replacement lessons is. This suboptimality could potentially be eliminated if substitution plans are considered at the time of the timetables construction. The aim of this work is to explore this aspect of optimizing timetables more closely, presenting a stochastic integer linear program to experimentally examine how promising such an optimization can be. Zusammenfassung Das Erstellen von Stundenplänen ist ein Problem das für viele Anwendungen relevant ist, allen voran für Bildungsinstutionen. Während Stundenpläne von Schulen eine Reflexion davon sind, wie der größte Teil des Tages sich voraussichtlich abspielen wird im Sinne von wann welche Kurse wo stattfinden und wer diese unterrichtet, sind unvor-hergesehene Ausfälle von Lehrkräften, die den Plan durchkreuzen, nicht ungewöhnlich. Leider können Stundenpläne, selbst wenn sie im Allgemeinen gut designed sind, qualita-tiv versagen, sobald es zu Vertretungsplänen kommt. Derartige Suboptimalität könnte potentiell vorweggenommen werden, wenn die Erstellung von Vertretungsplänen bei der initialen Konstruktion des Stundenplans mit in Betracht gezogen werden. Das Ziel die-ser Arbeit ist, diesen Aspekt der Optimierung von Stundenplänen näher zu untersuchen. Hierbei wird ein stochastisches, ganzzahliges lineares Programm vorgestellt, mit dessen Hilfe experimentell untersucht wird, wie vielversprechend eine solche Optimierung sei. 2},

   abstract = {University timetabling problems are a yearly challenging task and are faced repeatedly each semester. The problems are considered nonpolynomial time (NP) and combinatorial optimization problems (COP), which means that they can be solved through optimization algorithms to produce the aspired optimal timetable. Several techniques have been used to solve university timetabling problems, and most of them use optimization techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the most recent studies dealing with concepts, methodologies, optimization, benchmarks, and open issues of university timetabling problems. The comprehensive review starts by presenting the essence of university timetabling as NP-COP, defining and clarifying the two formed classes of university timetabling: University Course Timetabling and University Examination Timetabling, illustrating the adopted algorithms for solving such a problem, elaborating the university timetabling constraints to be considered achieving the optimal timetable, and explaining how to analyze and measure the performance of the optimization algorithms by demonstrating the commonly used benchmark datasets for the evaluation. It is noted that meta-heuristic methodologies are widely used in the literature. Additionally, recently, multi-objective optimization has been increasingly used in solving such a problem that can identify robust university timetabling solutions. Finally, trends and future directions in university timetabling problems are provided. This paper provides good information for students, researchers, and specialists interested in this area of research. The challenges and possibilities for future research prospects are also explored.},

   abstract = {Course timetables are the organizational foundation of a university’s educational program. While students and lecturers perceive timetable quality individually according to their preferences, there are also collective criteria derived normatively such as balanced workloads or idle time avoidance. A recent challenge and opportunity in curriculum-based timetabling consists of customizing timetables with respect to individual student preferences and with respect to integrating online courses as part of modern course programs or in reaction to flexibility requirements as posed in pandemic situations. Curricula consisting of (large) lectures and (small) tutorials further open the possibility for optimizing not only the lecture and tutorial plan for all students but also the assignments of individual students to tutorial slots. In this paper, we develop a multi-level planning process for university timetabling: On the tactical level, a lecture and tutorial plan is determined for a set of study programs; on the operational level, individual timetables are generated for each student interlacing the lecture plan through a selection of tutorials from the tutorial plan favoring individual preferences. We utilize this mathematical-programming-based planning process as part of a matheuristic which implements a genetic algorithm in order to improve lecture plans, tutorial plans, and individual timetables so as to find an overall university program with well-balanced timetable performance criteria. Since the evaluation of the fitness function amounts to invoking the entire planning process, we additionally provide a proxy in the form of an artificial neural network metamodel. Computational results exhibit the procedure’s capability of generating high quality schedules.},

   abstract = {This study describes a novel greedy algorithm for optimizing the well-known Curriculum-Based Course Timetabling (CB-CTT) problem. Greedy algorithms are a good alternative to brute-force and evolutionary algorithms, which take a long time to execute in order to find the best solution. Rather than employing a single heuristic, as many greedy algorithms do, we define and apply 120 new heuristics to the same problem instance. To assign courses to available rooms, our proposed greedy algorithm employs the Largest-First, Smallest-First, Best-Fit, Average-weight first, and Highest Unavailable course-first heuristics. Extensive experiments are carried out on 21 problem instances from the benchmark set of the Second International Timetabling Competition (ITC-2007). For 18 problems with significantly reduced soft-constraint values, the proposed greedy algorithm can report zero hard constraint violations (feasible solutions). The proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art greedy heuristics in terms of performance.Bu çalışma, iyi bilinen Müfredat Tabanlı Ders Çizelgeleme Problemini optimize etmek için yeni bir açgözlü algoritmayı açıklamaktadır.

Generating feasible timetables is a strenuous task that requires plenty of resources, which makes it impractical to take student preferences into consideration during the process. Timetabling and scheduling problems are proven to be NP-hard due to their complex nature and large search spaces. A genetic algorithm (GA) that assigns students to their classes based on their preferences is proposed as a solution to this problem and is implemented in this article. The GA's performance is enhanced by applying different metaheuristic concepts and by tailoring the genetic operators to the given problem. The quality of the solutions generated is boosted further with the unique repair and improvement functions that were implemented in conjunction with the genetic algorithm. The success of theGAwas evaluated by using different datasets of varying complexity and by assessing the quality of the solutions generated. The results obtained were promising and the algorithm guarantees the feasibility of solutions as well as satisfying more than 90% of student preferences even for the most complex problems.},

   abstract = {University course timetabling problem (UCTP) includes the challenging task of generating an automated timetable for courses under resource limitations. Manual generated timetables might hold some errors and consume a long time to create feasible solutions. Thus, there is a need to find optimal and fast solutions for this problem. The difficulty of the timetabling problem is further increased when tackling faculty-related constraints, according to their requirements, preferences, and availability. Thus, student-related constraints are usually the focus of UCTP generated solutions, in which faculty constraints are limited to their teaching load or preferences. This paper proposes a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model for a preregistration UCTP, combined with faculty-related constraints. The goal is to maximize events assignments and faculty-members preferences satisfaction while balancing the university requirements. At the same time, student learning days and unassigned events are minimized. The model is tested with eight real-world instances. Computational experiments are carried out to show the efficiency of the model. The proposed method can generate optimal timetables for all problem instances that satisfy faculty constraints.},

In this research, a multiobjective mixed-integer programming model was developed to provide a timetable for the postgraduate courses at the Industrial Engineering Department of Islamic Azad University, Najafabad Branch (IAUN). The proposed model minimized the violation of the lecturers and educational priorities, the student travel time between classes, and the classes' surplus capacity. To convert the multiobjective model into a single one, the ϵ-constraint method was adopted, and the model's accuracy and feasibility were examined through a real example solved by the CPLEX solver of GAMS software.

   abstract = {Solving university course timetabling problems is a large and complex task. Moreover, every new academic term, a new timetable is likely to be scheduled due to disruptions (e.g., changes in teacher-lecture allocation). Nevertheless, the university infrastructure, the overall curricular plans, and the number of students/teachers is still very similar in consecutive terms. For this reason, a timetable does not need to be always scheduled from scratch since it can produce a completely different solution from the previous one, thus creating undesirable changes for many actors. This paper addresses the Minimal Perturbation Problem (MPP) in university course timetabling. Given a set of disruptions that make a timetable no longer feasible, a solution to the MPP is the closest new feasible timetable with respect to the original timetable. We propose and analyze two different integer programming models to encode the MPP. To validate the proposed models, disruptions are randomly generated based on the probability distributions learned from the history of timetables over the last five years in the Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) the engineering school from Universidade de Lisboa. Overall, our models, combined with an incremental approach, are shown to be able to efficiently solve all problem instances.},

The domain of high school timetabling is not well developed when compared to other fields of educational timetabling such as university exam timetabling and course timetabling. As the evolution of the educational systems are continuous, new challenges often arise, requiring new models and solution methodologies.

This survey paper aims to provide a scientific review of high school timetabling. The paper presents a categorisation of the methodologies conducted in recent years based on chronology, category and application (dataset). We first present comparative studies on the success of proposed methodologies. The components and mechanisms of different methodologies are analysed and compared. We also discuss their performance, advantages, disadvantages and potential for improvement.

The model used the combination of mixed-integer and binary variables. It reaches the students' study time preferences, in which the number of the students in the same classroom is suitable for the training costs while preserving the business schedules. A compromise programming is used to transform a list of multiple objectives into a single objective function. We developed a Genetic Algorithm scheme to solve our proposed model. Finally, our proposed scheduler is evaluated with a real dataset of 3000 students. The results show the proposed method's effectiveness in both terms of solution quality and computational cost.},

This problem is in class NP-hard problems that are very difficult to solve with the classical algorithms. Several studies exist to resolve the many conflicting constraints that exist in a timetable schedule using computational intelligent approaches. These computational intelligent approaches simply search the domain space for a goal state that satisfies the problem constraints. Among these techniques, evolutionary algorithms proved to perform well to optimize the extreme timetabling constraints. A weighted sum formula was used to prioritize lecturers according to their availabilities handles conflicts. The algorithm incorporates several operators (selection, crossover, mutation) to enhance search efficiency and also ensure that the best chromosomes that are selected. The genetic algorithm was tested and compared with a set of other algorithms from the literature. The experimental results showed that the genetic algorithm was able to produce feasible results for the university teaching timetable. Future research can focus on applying iterative search techniques to find the best optimal solutions with regards to lecturer s' and students' availability especially for students repeating courses from the previous semesters.},

   abstract = {University course timetables are often finalized in stages, in between which, changes in the data make the earlier version infeasible. As each version is announced to the community, it is desirable to have a robust initial timetable, i.e. one that can be repaired with limited number of changes and yielding a new solution whose quality is degraded as little as possible. We define two versions of the robust timetabling problem, first one assuming that only one lecture is disrupted (its scheduled period ceasing to be feasible) and the second one assuming multiple lectures are disrupted. The objective of the algorithms is to identify a good Pareto front defined by the solution quality (penalty associated with soft-constraint violations) and the robustness measure. Two versions of a multi-objective simulated annealing (MOSA) algorithm is developed (MOSA-SD and MOSA-SAA, for single and multiple disruptions, respectively), with the difference being in the way robustness of a solution is estimated within the MOSA algorithm. Extensive computational experiments done using the International Timetabling Competition ITC-2007 data set confirm that MOSA-SD outperforms a genetic algorithm from the literature, and MOSA-SAA outperforms MOSA-SD when there are multiple disruptions. For MOSA-SAA an innovative solution network to structure feasible solutions for a set of disruption scenarios has been developed to efficiently perform sample average approximation (SAA) calculations, which can be adopted for other stochastic combinatorial optimization problems.},

In this work, the problem of finding a feasible solution for the UCTP, i.e., a solution that satisfies all hard constraints, is addressed. To cater for the algorithm design, the problem is firstly reformulated into a version where only one hard constraint needs to be considered in the minimization procedure. Then a novel Tabu search algorithm is proposed, which integrates the controlled randomization strategy and threshold mechanism into the original Tabu search framework. Experiments on a set of 60 well-known Lewis benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive results compared with eight reference algorithms. In particular, when the stop condition is relaxed, the proposed algorithm can find feasible solutions for all the 60 instances, two of which are missed in previous study.},

   abstract = {The University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP) is a scheduling problem of assigning teaching event in certain time and room by considering the constraints of university stakeholders such as students, lecturers, and departments. The constraints could be hard (encouraged to be satisfied) or soft (better to be fulfilled). This problem becomes complicated for universities which have an immense number of students and lecturers. Moreover, several universities are implementing student sectioning which is a problem of assigning students to classes of a subject while respecting individual student requests along with additional constraints. Such implementation enables students to choose a set of preference classes first then the system will create a timetable depend on their preferences. Subsequently, student sectioning significantly increases the problem complexity. As a result, the number of search spaces grows hugely multiplied by the expansion of students, other variables, and involvement of their constraints. However, current and generic solvers failed to meet scalabil-ity requirement for student sectioning UCTP. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Depth Genetic Algorithm (MDGA) to solve student sectioning UCTP. MDGA uses the multiple stages of GA computation including multi-level mutation and multi-depth constraint consideration. Our research shows that MDGA could produce a feasible timetable for student sectioning problem and get better results than previous works and current UCTP solver. Furthermore, our experiment also shows that MDGA could compete with other UCTP solvers albeit not the best one for the ITC-2007 benchmark dataset.},

The gap between the best solution obtained by the proposed method and the optimum solution computed by CPLEX solver is around 19.6%.

Because schedulers can decide the consecutiveness and periodicity constraints for the multi-session lectures within a limited ratio, we consider these novel decision variables in our model. We develop a mixed integer linear program for the UTP. For the analysis, we convert the UTP into the three-dimensional container packing problem (3DCPP) and create a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), which has been shown to be efficient in solving the 3DCPP. We also develop a tabu search algorithm based on the existing UTP literature and compare the findings with that of our HGA. The results show that our HGA obtains a better solution than the tabu search algorithm in a reasonable amount of time.},

   abstract = {The assembling process of an academic timetable structure is one of hardest scholar planning tasks. A well done schedule requires considerable time, because of many factors involved (e.g. professor availability, courses and their workload, students and classrooms). Based on related researches, it is possible to claim that in the most of the institutions, the solution is done by manual work, which requires more time and effort. Although the search for the best solution is infeasible, it is possible to find near optimal solutions using heuristics. Most current solutions provide answers optimizing administrative factors, i.e. considering mainly the factors related to the disciplines, classrooms and professors, not considering students needs, e.g. reducing time gaps between non-consecutive classes. In this work, we focus on the timetable improvement for the students and assess our results using real data from a Brazilian university.},

More precisely, we investigate the application of two population-based algorithms, namely a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and an Artificial Fish Swarm (AFS), on the high school timetabling problem. In order to demonstrate their efficiency and performance, experiments with real-world input data have been performed. Both algorithms proposed manage to create feasible and efficient high school timetables, thus fulfilling adequately the timetabling needs of the respective high schools. Computational results demonstrate that both algorithms manage to reach efficient solutions, most of the times better than existing approaches applied to the same school timetabling input instances using the same evaluation criteria.},

   abstract = {Scheduling is one of the problems which so many researches have been conducted on it over the years. The university course timetabling problem which is an NP-hard problem is a type of scheduling problem. Timetabling process must be done for each semester frequently, which is an exhausting and time consuming task. The allocation of whole of events in timeslots and rooms performs by the university course timetabling process considering the list of hard and soft constraints presented in one semester, so that no conflict is created in such allocations. In the university course timetabling problem (UCTTP), the hard constraints should not be violated under any conditions; soft constraints also should not be violated as much as possible. The aim of the present paper is to analyze available approaches in the study of university course timetabling problems, including operational researches, metaheuristic methods and intelligent novel methods; also the distributed multi agent systems based approach (Cooperative Search method) is investigated due to its scalability which enables the timetabling of common events between departments. In addition, in this work a complete introduction of reliable datasets has been given to test and evaluation of the structure of considered algorithms.},

   abstract = {Process planning and jobshop scheduling problems are both crucial functions in manufacturing. In reality, dynamic disruptions such as machine breakdown or rush order will affect the feasibility and optimality of the sequentially-generated process plans and machining schedules. With the approach of integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS), the actual process plan and the schedule are determined dynamically in accordance with the order details and the status of the manufacturing system. In this paper, an object-coding genetic algorithm (OCGA) is proposed to resolve the IPPS problems in a jobshop type of flexible manufacturing systems. An effective object-coding representation and its corresponding genetic operations are suggested, where real objects like machining operations are directly used to represent genes. Based on the object-coding representation, customized methods are proposed to fulfill the genetic operations. An unusual selection and a replacement strategy are integrated systematically for the population evolution, aiming to achieve near-optimal solutions through gradually improving the overall quality of the population, instead of exploring neighborhoods of good individuals. Experiments show that the proposed genetic algorithm can generate outstanding outcomes for complex IPPS instances.},

The first one is general method and takes time in days , months and years as N increases. In this paper the time taken by the two methods for a given value of N are compared. The work has restricted values of N upto 50 only as beyond this it is extremely difficult to get the solution of the problem using backtracking method. Both the implementation have been carried out in MATLAB using Pentium Core 2 Duo T6600 Core 2.2 GHz processor on Windows 8 with 4GB RAM. Because of the random nature of GA instead of time taken in obtaining all possible solutions for a given value of N, the time taken in obtaining say count number of solutions was first determined using GA, then time taken in same number of solutions that is count using backtracking was noted. Results are then presented in tabular manner.},

   abstract = {The high school timetabling is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that takes a large number of variables and constraints into account. Due to its combinatorial nature, solving medium and large instances to optimality is a challenging task. When resources are tight, it is often difficult to find even a feasible solution. Among the different requirements that are considered in Brazilian schools, two compactness requirements must be met on a teachers schedule: the minimization of working days and the avoidance of idle timeslots. In this paper, we present a mixed integer linear programming model and a fix-and-optimize heuristic combined with a variable neighborhood descent method. Our method uses three different types of decompositions - class, teacher and day - in order to solve the high school timetabling problem. The method is able to find new best known solutions for seven instances, including three optimal ones. A comparison with results reported in the literature shows that the proposed fix-and-optimize heuristic outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for the resolution of the problem at hand. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper we introduce, illustrate, and discuss genetic algorithms for beginning users. We show what components make up genetic algorithms and how to write them. Using MATLAB, we program several examples, including a genetic algorithm that solves the classic Traveling Salesman Problem. We also discuss the history of genetic algorithms, current applications, and future developments. Genetic algorithms are a type of optimization algorithm, meaning they are used to find the optimal solution(s) to a given computational problem that maximizes or minimizes a particular function. Genetic algorithms represent one branch of the field of study called evolutionary computation [4], in that they imitate the biological processes of reproduction and natural selection to solve for the 'fittest' solutions [1]. Like in evolution, many of a genetic algorithm's processes are random, however this optimization technique allows one to set the level of randomization and the level of control [1]. These algorithms are far more powerful and efficient than random search and exhaustive search algorithms [4], yet require no extra information about the given problem. This feature allows them to find solutions to problems that other optimization methods cannot handle due to a lack of continuity, derivatives, linearity, or other features.},

And then the concept of controlling risk regulation gradient is put forward, and the method of calculating risk regulation gradient is expatiated in detail. The nerve network is suitable for recognizing and simulating nonlinear system, and the wavelet transformation or the decomposition displays the good time frequency localization characteristic and the multi-criteria function, therefore the wavelet nerve network based on the wavelet decomposition and the nerve network has the good fault-tolerant ability and the non-linearity approaching performance. And based on this, a complete controlling risk model of cooperatively technical innovation is brought forward, and the algorithm of risk control model is discussed. © 2007 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The genetic algorithm (GA) and a related procedure called the grouping genetic algorithm (GGA) are solution methodologies used to search for optimal solutions in constrained optimization problems. While the GA has been successfully applied to a range of problem types, the GGA was created specifically for problems involving the formation of groups. Falkenauer (JORBEL - Belg. J. Oper. Res. Stat. Comput. Sci. 33 (1992) 79), the originator of the GGA, and subsequent researchers have proposed reasons for expecting the GGA to perform more efficiently than the GA on grouping problems. Yet, there has been no research published to date which tests claims of GGA superiority. This paper describes empirical tests of the performance of GA and GGA in three domains which have substantial, practical importance, and which have been the subject of considerable academic research. Our purpose is not to determine which of these two approaches is better across an entire problem domain, but rather to begin to document practical differences between a standard off-the-shelf GA and a tailored GGA. Based on the level of solution quality desired, it may be the case that the additional time and resources required to design a tailored GGA may not be justified if the improvement in solution quality is only minor or non-existent. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {This paper describes techniques that can be applied to a different scheduling and timetabling problems. The problems are characterized as constraints satisfaction problems. The solution methodology uses genetic algorithms to minimize the total penaIty for constraint violation. An encoding, genetic operators and fitness evaluation are implemented. To solve this problem a genetic algorithm maintains a population of chromosomes each of which represents a possible solution (timetable). In every generation, a new population of chromosomes is created using bits and pieces of the fittest of the old generation. The main tasks of applying genetic algorithm to solve a problem are encoding the solution as chromosome, developing a fitness evaluation function and choosing genetic operators and run parameters. The genetic algorithm includes the following functions: initialize, evaluate, select, crossover, mu-rate, create new population. Our genetic algorithm proposes solution which consists of number of tuples , one for each class. The timetabling constraints are classified: unary constraints , binary constraints and k-nary constraints. The fitness function is a linear combination of a cost function and a penalty function. The goal is all constraints to be satisfied. .We use constraint propagation approach. There are experimental results.},

We report a recent practical work (a timetabling instrument) showing an unusual degree of openness for interaction, and we give evidence that our approach can encompass conventional tools such as expert systems.

   abstract = {In this paper, the timetabling problem for a typical high school environment was modeled and solved using a constraint programming (CP) approach. In addition, operations research (OR) models and local search techniques were also used in order to assist the CP search process by eectively reducing the solution search space. Relaxed models that can be solved using minimum cost matching algorithms were used in order to calculate problem lower bounds at various instances of the solution process. These bounds were in turn used to prioritize the search options of the CP process. The use of minimum cost matching model in the search process is an economical and ecient mechanism for the creation of eective search strategies and it is a competitive manner of introducing problem domain information in the CP environment. By including in the solution process a sequence of local search steps, the solution quality was further improved. Several large problems were solved and actual computational results for specic problem instances are presented. Scope and purpose There exist various school timetabling problems depending on the environment and the characteristics of the particular school level [1]. In this paper the high school situation in which the teachers teach in several dierent class sections during the day and the students remain in their classrooms is modeled and solved. The objective function attempts to minimize the idle hours between the daily teaching responsibilities of all the teachers while also attempting to satisfy their requests for early or late shift assignments. The school timetabling problem is combinatorial and there are several strict organizational and sequence-related rules that must be respected. The problem specications used in this paper, although they closely describe the situation of a typical Greek high school, are quite general and abstract, which makes the ndings of this paper applicable to wider set of school timetabling problems. The specications mainly focus on the fact that each teacher is scheduled to lecture for a given number of hours at a xed subset of class sections and the requirement that all the class sections must be always in session without any empty periods in their daily schedules. The integration of constraint programming and operations research techniques for the solution of this problem is one of the main contributions of this paper. The solutions obtained fully utilized the data management and organizational capabilities of the constraint programming approach while being assisted in the search path selection process by techniques and algorithms form the operations research pool of knowledge. The additional information provided by the calculation of ecient lower bounds and the subproblem domain denition and solution strategy presented in this paper, further assists the CP process in selecting promising search paths.},

   abstract = {This paper is to study the encoding techniques of Genetic Algorithms and a sufficient convergence condition on genetic encoding in Genetic Algorithms is presented. Some new categories of genetic codes are defined, such as Uniform code, Bias Code, Tri-sector Code and Symmetric Codes etc, and they are applied in some problem optimizations and robotic problem solution. These codes have found their application in developing some special and powerful Genetic Algorithms. For example, based on Symmetric Codes theory, new genetic strategy, GASC: Genetic Algorithm with Symmetric Code, is developed. In the current paper, some key defmitions on encoding are given out, such as Living-block, Dead-block, Link, Fix-link, Living-population, as well as some operation on genetic, such as Bit-transposition, Bit-and, Population-and and Member-and etc. Some of our research shows that genetic encoding techniques have very important influence on the performance of Genetic Algorithms. The convergence speed of Genetic Algorithms with some special developed codes will be much faster than conventional Genetic Algorithms. That is very significant for finding more applications of Genetic Algorithms, as, in many cases, Genetic Algorithms' applications are limited by their convergence speed.},

   abstract = {Genetic algorithms provide an alternative to traditional optimization techniques by using directed random searches to locate optimal solutions in complex landscapes. n the last five years, genetic algorithms have emerged as practical, robust optimization and search methods. Diverse areas such as music generation, genetic synthesis, VLSI technology, strategy planning, and machine learning have profited from these methods. The popularity of genetic algorithms is reflected in three biennial conferences, a new international journal, and an ever-increasing mass of literature devoted to the theory, practice, and applications of such techniques (see the sidebar "To learn more"). Genetic algorithm search methods are rooted in the mechanisms of evolution and natural genetics. The interest in heuristic search algorithms with underpinnings in natural and physical processes began as early as the 1970s, when Holland' first proposed genetic algorithms. This interest was rekindled by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt, and Vecchi's simulated annealing technique in 1983.2 Simulated annealing is based on thermodynamic considerations, with annealing interpreted as an optimization procedure. Evolutionary ~ t r a t e g i e s ~. ~ and genetic algorithm^,^.'^ on the other hand, draw inspiration from the natural search and selection processes leading to the survival of the fittest individuals. Simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and evolutionary strategies are similar in their use of a probabilistic search mechanism directed toward decreasing cost or increasing payoff. These three methods have a high probability of locating the global solution optimally in a multimodal search landscape. (A multimodal cost function has several locally optimal solutions as well.) However, each method has a significantly different mode of operation. Simulated annealing probabilistically generates a sequence of states based on a cooling schedule to ultimately converge to the global optimum. Evolutionary strategies use mutations as search mechanisms and selection to direct the search toward the prospective regions in the search space. Genetic algorithms generate a sequence of populations by using a selection mechanism, and use crossover and mutation as search mechanisms. The principal difference between genetic algorithms and evolutionary strategies is that genetic algorithms rely on crossover, a mechanism of probabilistic and useful exchange of information among solutions, to locate better solutions, while evolutionary strategies use mutation as the primary search mechanism.
