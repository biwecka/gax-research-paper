\section{Introduction}
% What is educational timetabling
Educational timetabling involves creating schedules for educational
institutions such as schools, colleges, and universities.
The problem domain can be divided into the following three main problems
\cite{kingston2013educational,schaerf1999survey}:
High-School Timetabling (HTT), University Course Timetabling (CTT) and
University Examination Timetabling (ETT).
Although a clear distinction between these three problems is not always
possible, they generally differ significantly from one another
\cite{Beligiannis2009}.
However, each of these problems essentially is a resource allocation problem
with the goal of assigning classrooms, instructors, and students to specific
time slots for various courses or activities, ensuring that all constraints and
requirements are met.
This includes avoiding conflicts (e.g., a student being scheduled for two
classes at the same time), adhering to institutional policies, and maximizing
the efficient use of resources.

% Why is it complicated?
The difficulty in finding a valid and effective solution to such a problem
lies in meeting the diverse requirements of different stakeholders
(e.g. students, teachers, administration), multiple constraints and resolving
resource conflicts in a combinatorial complex solution space caused by the
numerous constraints.
Timetabling problems like these are therefore known to be NP-complete in their
general form, meaning that the difficulty of finding a solution increases
exponentially with the problem size, which in turn makes it impossible to find
a deterministic algorithm providing an acceptable solution in polynomial time
\cite{Beligiannis2009}.
%
% What are solutions to the problem?
One popular approach to addressing the complexity of timetabling problems is the
use of metaheuristic algorithms \cite{Beligiannis2009}.
This class of algorithms leverages a non-deterministic search approach which
compromises on finding an optimal solution in favor of better runtime
performance. Consequently, such algorithms are not guaranteed to find
the best solution for a given problem, but a near optimal one
\cite{Affenzeller2009}.
Despite this limitation, metaheuristic algorithms are widely used in educational
timetabling due to their ability to provide high-quality solutions within
a reasonable timeframe.
These algorithms can be broadly classified into two categories: single-solution
and population-based metaheuristics \cite{Katoch2021}.
Single-solution based algorithms use a single candidate solution and iteratively
improve it by using local search, but are prone to get stuck in local maxima
\cite{Katoch2021}.
Population-based metaheuristics on the other hand work on multiple candidate
solutions during the search process, avoiding the risk of getting stuck
in a local maximum by maintaining diversity among the solution candidates
\cite{Katoch2021}.
Popular single-solution based algorithms in the timetabling domain are
simulated annealing, local search and Tabu search
\cite{Ceschia2023, Katoch2021}.
Well-known population based metaheuristics are genetic algorithms, particle
swarm optimization and ant colony systems \cite{Beligiannis2009, Katoch2021}.

% Solving problems of such complexity in a practicable timeframe is therefore
% mostly done by using metaheuristic algorithms, which find solutions to
% optimization problems but are not guaranteed to find the best solution.
% Therefore, optimization algorithms trying to find (near) optimal solutions have
% been used as alternative methods of solving educational timetabling problems.
% Examples for such methods are local search and simulated annealing techniques
% as well as computational intelligence algorithms like genetic algorithms (GAs),
% Tabu Search, Ant Systems and other metaheuristic approaches
% \cite{Beligiannis2009}.

% The algorithm of interest; Why are GAs well suited for timetabling?
Among these methods, genetic algorithms are known for their versatility and
application in a variety of use cases with the need of searching for solutions
of a combinatorial problem in a large solution space.
Therefore, this paper specifically focuses on genetic algorithms and how they
are used in the domain of educational timetabling.

% What is a GA?
Genetic algorithms (abbr. \textit{GA}) are a heuristic search method inspired by
the process of natural selection in biological evolution and thus belong to
the group of evolutionary algorithms \cite{Katoch2021}. As mentioned previously,
genetic algorithms utilize a population based approach, meaning multiple
solution candidates are iteratively evolved through numerous generations
imitating the Darwinian theory of survival of the fittest \cite{Katoch2021}.

% Introduce structure here? Or better do this in the "Methods" chapter?


%% Methods ------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
\section{Methods}
This paper specifically focuses on the application of genetic algorithms
in the domain of educational timetabling and not timetabling or scheduling
problems in general.
To accomplish this, a thorough search among recent and early publications on
this topic has been conducted, to create a representative overview of the most
important concepts of genetic search used in the field of timetabling.
After an introduction of the basic and some advanced concepts of genetic
algorithms, the research results will be visualized and discussed.

%% Basic Concepts ----------------------------------------------------------- %%
\section{Basic Concepts}
% Introduction into GAs
% - GA is an optimization algorithm
% - inspired from natural selection (and genetics)
% - work on a set/population of chromosomes
% - population based search algorithm utilizing survival of the fittest
%   - each chromosome is a member of the population
%   - population consists of multiple chromosomes
% - work on strings of data called chromosomes

% - new populations are produces by iterative use of genetic operators on
%   individuals in the population
% - chromosome representation (encoding), selection, crossover, mutation and 
%   fitness function are key elements of any GA
% - general procedure of a GA:

% - constraints
%   - equality constraints: can usually be incorporated within the fitness
%     function
%   - inequality constraints: may be handled in two ways
%     - evaluate objective function and check if any constraints are violated
%       - if not, all good
%       - if so, solution/chromosome is unacceptable and assigned no fitness
%     - penalty method, decreasing the fitness value of strings/chromosomes
%       that violate the constraints by an amount proportional to the cost of
%       violating that constraint.
%       thus the problem is actually transformed into an unconstrained one with
%       a different (peanalized) objective function
%

Genetic algorithms are a type of search and optimization algorithm inspired
by the biological process of reproduction and natural selection and represent
one branch in the field of evolutionary computing \cite{goldberg1989, Carr2014}.

In the search for a solution to an optimization problem, the set of possible
solutions -- the so-called solution space -- must first be determined and made
comprehensible for an algorithm in form of a data structure, which is suitable
for representing a solution \cite{Affenzeller2009}.
This representation of the solution is also called \textit{encoding} and
contains the data of a possible solution to the problem to be solved.
In nature, this data is encoded on chromosomes. Similarly, in genetic algorithms
the possible solution in coded form is also called \textit{chromosome} or
\textit{individual} \cite{Affenzeller2009}.

In addition, genetic algorithms employ a population based search approach,
whereby instead of a single potential solution a whole set of solutions is
iteratively improved. Such a set of solutions is called \textit{population}
and consists of multiple chromosomes. The stages of iterative improvements
are called \textit{generations} \cite{Affenzeller2009}.

In order for the algorithm to optimize towards a desired solution, it is
necessary to have a measure in place to evaluate and compare the chromosomes.
This value referred to as \textit{fitness} and is provided by the
\textit{fitness function} (also called \textit{objective function})
\cite{Affenzeller2009}.

With these basic terms defined, the general process of genetic algorithms
can now be described as follows:
First, an \textit{initial population} must be created and the fitness of its
chromosomes must be evaluated \cite{Affenzeller2009}.
Pairs (or triples, quadruples, etc.) are then selected
(\textit{selection} phase) from this population in order to reproduce
(known as \textit{crossover}) \cite{Affenzeller2009}.
The resulting offspring may undergo one or more mutations
(\textit{mutation} phase) with a defined probability before the fitness of
these new chromosomes is determined (\textit{evaluation} phase)
\cite{Affenzeller2009}.
Based on certain criteria chromosomes from the current generation and their
offspring are now selected, to replace the population with a new one
(\textit{replacement} phase) \cite{Affenzeller2009}.
The result of this step is a new generation of chromosomes forming a new
(usually fitter) population \cite{Affenzeller2009}.
From this population, chromosomes are once again selected for reproduction,
starting the process all over again \cite{Affenzeller2009}.
The genetic algorithm could theoretically continue indefinitely according to
this pattern, with termination conditions serving as the only means of halting
the process \cite{Beligiannis2009}.
%
The forementioned phases of genetic algorithms will be explained in the
following chapters.

\subsection{Encoding}
Genetic algorithms require two essential components: an encoding and
a fitness function \cite{Affenzeller2009}.
The encoding plays a pivotal role in the design of a genetic algorithm
\cite{Katoch2021}.
Its most significant property is that it can completely represent the solution
space of the problem at hand, thereby deriving the potential solution to the
problem from a given chromosome \cite{Affenzeller2009}.
Moreover, the encoding must be designed in consideration of the data
processing of other genetic algorithm components, such as the fitness function
and the crossover operator \cite{Affenzeller2009}.
The fitness function must calculate the fitness value based on this
representation of a solution candidate, and the crossover operator should
generate offspring that are as valid as possible \cite{Affenzeller2009}.
In particular, the latter aspect can often only be fulfilled by an adapted,
domain-specific representation \cite{Affenzeller2009}.
%
The following paragraphs present some well-known encodings.

\subsubsection{Binary Encoding}
% \subsubsection{Hexadecimal Encoding}
% \subsubsection{Decimal Encoding}
\subsubsection{Permutation Encoding}
\subsubsection{Value Encoding}
% \subsubsection{Tree Encoding}
\subsubsection{List Encoding}
\subsubsection{Matrix Encoding}


\subsection{Fitness Function}
The fitness function of a genetic algorithm is arguably its most crucial
component \cite{Beligiannis2009}.
\enquote{It is the only chance that you have to communicate your intentions
to the powerful process that genetic programming represents. Make sure
that it communicates precisely what you desire}\cite{kinnear1994perspective}.
Especially in the context of constrained optimization problems with multiple
objectives (e.g. hard and soft constraints), the fitness function must be
carefully designed to convey the correct optimization target for solving the
problem at hand \cite{Beligiannis2009,Carr2014}.

% the design of the fitness function is highly dependent on the choosen encoding,
% yet there are some popular approaches, especially for multi-objective ...

% timetabling problems usually are multi-objective optimization problems
% -> because of that, we'll focus on multi-objective fitness functions
% \cite{Beligiannis2009}.

% easiest is probably counting the amount of constraint violations
% (of hard and/or soft constraints)

% another possibility is calculating a wheighted sum


\subsection{Initial Population}
Once an appropriate encoding and a fitness function have been identifier,
the first step in the actual execution of the algorithm is to generate an
initial population \cite{Affenzeller2009}.

% popular options: random or heuristic
% if domain allows for heuristic generation of valid chromosomes, that might
% pose and advantage for the development of the population
% but oftentimes it's hard to find valid solution candidates in the first place,
% so only random initialization of the population is viable.
