\section{Introduction}
% What is educational timetabling
Educational timetabling involves creating schedules for educational
institutions such as schools, colleges, and universities.
The problem domain can be divided into the following three main problems
\cite{kingston2013educational,schaerf1999survey}:
High-School Timetabling (HTT), University Course Timetabling (CTT) and
University Examination Timetabling (ETT).
Although a clear distinction between these three problems is not always
possible, they generally differ significantly from one another
\cite{Beligiannis2009}.
However, each of these problems essentially is a resource allocation problem
with the goal of assigning classrooms, instructors, and students to specific
time slots for various courses or activities, ensuring that all constraints and
requirements are met.
This includes avoiding conflicts (e.g., a student being scheduled for two
classes at the same time), adhering to institutional policies, and maximizing
the efficient use of resources.

% Why is it complicated?
The difficulty in finding a valid and effective solution to such a problem
lies in meeting the diverse requirements of different stakeholders
(e.g. students, teachers, administration), multiple constraints and resolving
resource conflicts in a combinatorial complex solution space caused by the
numerous constraints.
Timetabling problems like these are therefore known to be NP-complete in their
general form, meaning that the difficulty of finding a solution increases
exponentially with the problem size, which in turn makes it impossible to find
a deterministic algorithm providing an acceptable solution in polynomial time
\cite{Beligiannis2009}.
%
% What are solutions to the problem?
Therefore, optimization algorithms trying to find (near) optimal solutions have
been used as alternative methods of solving educational timetabling problems.
Examples for such methods are local search and simulated annealing techniques
as well as computational intelligence algorithms like genetic algorithms (GAs),
Tabu Search, Ant Systems and other metaheuristic approaches
\cite{Beligiannis2009}.
